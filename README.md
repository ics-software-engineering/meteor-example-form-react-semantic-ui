Things to do:

* Subscribe to StudentData in CreateStudent page. 
* Check for existing email address; fail the create if found.
* Add setState to save the email address when create is successful, display the link.

* Implement the editStudentData page.
* Write the index.md
* Create the screencast. Maybe a PPT to start.
* Create enrollment collection, it has email and enrollment date as fields.
* Have form combine data from both collections, and show how to update both. That motivates separate form schema.
* add email field as slug

* Need to use consistent case for all file names. Here and in meteor-application-template-react.
