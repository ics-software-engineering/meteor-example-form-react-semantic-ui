Things to do:

* Move form schema etc into its own file, import into two pages using it.
* Create transform functions: gpa2string and gpa2number. They take a JSON object and replace the gpa field.
* Write the collection schema with gpa as a number.
* Implement the editStudentData page.
* Write the index.md
* Create the screencast. Maybe a PPT to start.
* Create enrollment collection, it has email and enrollment date as fields.
* Have form combine data from both collections, and show how to update both. That motivates separate form schema.
* add email field as slug

* Need to use consistent case for all file names. Here and in meteor-application-template-react.
