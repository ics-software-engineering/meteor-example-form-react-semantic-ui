Things to do:

* Move form schema etc into its own file, import into two pages using it.
* Create transform functions: gpa2string and gpa2number. They take a JSON object and replace the gpa field.
* Write the collection schema with gpa as a number.
* Implement the editStudentData page.
* Write the index.md
* Create the screencast. Maybe a PPT to start.
